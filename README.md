# data-structure-editing-macros #
Edit abstract data structures through vim-inspired commands on the terminal

## Purpose ##
This is a C++ terminal application made to familiarize myself with abstract data structures and the concept of computational complexity. The purpose is to replicate the standard template library's hash table and create a trie from scratch.

## Technologies Used ##
Only the C++ standard library is used to create the trie and hashtable.
